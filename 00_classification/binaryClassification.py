"""
    1. f_w(x) = sign(w.phi(x)) where w.phi(x) are called score or margin and phi(x) is feature vector or in simple terms array of data and w represents weights
    
    Overall, f_w(x) is called y_hat.

    1. We will be given inputs as x(phi(x) or feature vectors) in an array or any data structure.
    2. secondly weight vectors also in an array
    3. Also true_y which is given or sometimes we are asked to find, its a true labeled value which we compare with predicted or y_hat.
